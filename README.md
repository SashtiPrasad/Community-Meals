# Quarantine meals project

â€œQuarantine meals'' is a platform that connects people who are looking for healthy and homecooked meals with local home cooks who are able to prepare these meals. The website was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has made it difficult or unsafe for many people to dine out or prepare meals at home.

This project is a website for ordering meals from home chefs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can browse and select meals from a list of chefs, add items to their cart, and place an order. The website also includes features such as user authentication and several functionalities for users to view and cancel their past orders and a cart system for users to add and purchase meals., as well as a page for chefs to update their information and menu items. The website uses a MySQL database to store information about chefs, food items, and orders and makes use of SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data, and PHP to handle server-side logic and connect to the database. Additionally, it uses the Materialize CSS framework for styling and some JavaScript for interactivity.
